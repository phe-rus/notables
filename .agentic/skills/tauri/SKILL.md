## When to use this skill

Use this skill as the **primary entry point** for any Tauri-related request. It serves as a "Total Index" (like `nvm`) that routes you to specific sub-skills.

**Why?**
- **Token Efficiency**: Each sub-skill contains local `examples/` and `templates/` directories, providing detailed, offline-ready documentation without expensive network searches.
- **Tauri v2 Ready**: All sub-skills are updated for Tauri v2.0+ (plugins, capabilities, permissions).

## How to use this skill

1.  **Identify Intent**: Determine if the user needs setup, specific plugin functionality (FS, Dialog, SQL), or core app configuration.
2.  **Route**: Invoke the specific sub-skill listed below.
3.  **Explore**: Inside the sub-skill, use `examples/usage.md` for step-by-step guides and `templates/capabilities.json` for permission configs.
